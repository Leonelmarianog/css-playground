          <p>
            Unlike many outdoor sports, getting started with bouldering is
            surprisingly simple. All you need are some climbing shoes, chalk,
            and a positive attitude—most gyms even rent the equipment for your
            first sessions.
            <strong>No prior experience or complex gear required!</strong>
          </p>

              <h3>Know Before You Go</h3>
              <p>
                Before you start climbing, learn proper falling technique and
                always check your landing zone. Taking basic safety precautions
                and learning gym etiquette will help ensure a fun and
                injury-free experience.
