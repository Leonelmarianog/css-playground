            <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>

            <p>
              Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small
              rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes
              or harnesses.
            </p>

            <p>
              Unlike <a href="#">traditional climbing</a>, bouldering focuses on
              short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping
              climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they
              navigate challenging sequences of moves.
